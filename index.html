         <p> While New Yorkers and Angelinos might feign cool indifference to a celebrity sighting in their neighborhood, it seems almost impossible for Alaskans to not want to take a picture with one “Star” in particular. Star, the unofficial mascot of Anchorage, Alaska’s most populous city, is the seventh reindeer since the 1960s to bear the name and title.

    <p> Between March 19 and September 23, Anchorage gets more hours of daily sunlight than anywhere in the other 49 states. Alaska adventures fill all those daylight hours. Hiking, biking, flightseeing, and dog sledding continue well past 8 p.m. Restaurants make use of decks or set out bistro tables on the side walk. The long summer holds a special treat for golfers. Tee times can be as late as 10 p.m. for each of Anchorage's three 18-hole golf courses.

     <p>A wave is generated when the leading edge of an incoming high tide collides with the outgoing low tide in the long, narrow channels of Turnagain Arm, creating a choppy and turbulent wave front. When conditions are right, the wave can last for miles as it moves up the Inlet. At 10 to 20 mph, the wave tumbles over the calmer outgoing tide, creating a wall of water cresting as high as 10 feet. There are 60 bore tides around the world, but few this large. Click the link to read more about it!

    <p> Glaciers have shaped the Anchorage area for thousands of years. Visiting one can be the trip of a lifetime, but that doesn’t mean it is difficult. By boat and plane, on foot, behind a team of dogs, and even sitting at a first-class restaurant with views of seven nearby glaciers – Anchorage is your window on Alaska's best glaciers.
